1. Not sticking to bed.
- Calibrated nozzle to bed distance.
- Added clear hair spray (this is really nice, but I should try to get away from it, if possible).
- Set bed temp to 60. But that might be too low. People are using 70-80, I should definitely try that.
- Added brim, but with hair spray and 60c, this is really not needed.

2. Overextruding. Struggled with this one for a while, till I realized that I'm using too many perimieters, and adjusted fillament size to the actual one (which was 1.77 not 1.75).

3. Curling or rough corners (corners are lifting on small parts, not in first layers) (something like this: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#curling-or-rough-corners)
I need to try lower temperature, and slower speed. Indeed, looks like 195 I'm priting PLA with is a bit too high. I am using active print cooling already.

4.  Layer shifting (something like this: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#layer-shifting-or-misalignment).
Struggled with this with killbot(). Even added active cooling for drivers, and increased current, and tighteneed belts. Did not help.
Then I finally say what happens! The curling (from previous item), causes the printer head to hit the print, and then it misses X and Y steps. Need to fix curling!
